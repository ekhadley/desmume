# HeartGold “Hardcore 50/50” Nuzlocke

A single, coherent ruleset tuned so an average player has roughly ≤50% odds of clearing Johto on the first attempt. It’s the standard Hardcore backbone (level caps, Set, no items in battle) with a few Johto-specific restrictions to keep it honest but not miserable.

## Core Rules
- **Faint = dead.** Perma-box or release.
- **First encounter per area.** Each named location = 1 encounter total (grass/cave/fish/surf all share the slot). You may choose the method you attempt first; if it fails, that area is forfeited.
- **Species/Dupes clause (3-try limit).** If your first encounter is a species you’ve already caught or its line, you may skip up to **two** times. On the **third** legal encounter, you must take it or forfeit.
- **Shiny clause.** Shiny may always be caught; if from a new area, it uses the slot.
- **Static & gifts.** Allowed but **they consume that area’s slot** (e.g., Togepi egg = Violet City; Red Gyarados = Lake of Rage). Choose **either** the static/gift **or** a wild from that area, not both.
- **Legendaries banned** for battle use (may catch to remove from pool, but that burns the area).
- **No external trading/Mystery Gift/Pokéwalker items.**

## Battle/Progression Rules
- **Battle Style: Set.**
- **No items in battle** (Poké Balls only). Held items are allowed.
- **Level caps = next boss’s ace.** If you’re at/over the cap, that Pokémon **may not enter** that fight. If you level up past the cap mid-fight, that’s fine.
- **No daycare. No intentional EV grinding.** Natural EVs are fine; **no vitamins/power items**.
- **TMs/tutors:** TMs are single-use as in HGSS. Limit **1 new TM per Pokémon before the Elite Four**. Move tutors are allowed but be sparing (treat like TMs).

## Johto Boss Caps (for convenience)
- Falkner **13** · Bugsy **17** · Whitney **19** · Morty **25**  
- Chuck **31** · Pryce **34** · Jasmine **35** · Clair **41**  
- Elite Four aces roughly **42/44/46/47**; **Lance 50**

## World/Overworld Rules
- **Safari Zone** (all layouts) = **one** total encounter for the entire zone.
- **Headbutt trees**: the **town** or **route** name determines the area; still one total.
- **Fishing on towns** with water (e.g., Cherrygrove, Olivine): counts as that town’s encounter.

## End Condition
- The run **ends after beating Lance**. You can carry on into Kanto under the same rules if you want a postgame challenge, but the 50/50 tuning is for Johto → Lance.

## Why this hits the difficulty you want
- **Set + no items + caps** are the big three that punish mistakes and force team planning.  
- **Limited TMs** and **no daycare/EV cheese** prevent over-optimized bulldozing.  
- **Dupes clause (3-try)** preserves variety (coverage) without handing you perfect rosters.
